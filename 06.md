NUT-09: Mint information
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

This endpoint returns information about the mint that a wallet can show to the user and use to make decisions on how to interact with the mint.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/info
```

With the mint's response being of the form `GetInfoResponse`:

```json
{
  "name": "Bob's Cashu mint",
  "pubkey": "0283bf290884eed3a7ca2663fc0260de2e2064d6b355ea13f98dec004b7a7ead99",
  "version": "Nutshell/0.15.0",
  "description": "The short mint description",
  "description_long": "A description that can be a long piece of text.",
  "methods": [
    ["bolt11", "sat"]
  ],
  "nuts": [
    "NUT-07", "NUT-08", "NUT-09", "NUT-10", "NUT-11", "NUT-12"
  ],
  "contact": [
    ["email", "contact@me.com"],
    ["twitter", "@me"],
    ["nostr" ,"npub..."]
  ],  
  "motd": "Message to display to users."
  "parameter": {
    "peg_out_only": false
  }
}
```

- `name` is the name of the mint and should be recognizable. 
- `pubkey` is the hex pubkey of the mint.
- `version` is the implementation name and the version of the software running on this mint separated with a slash "/", 
- `description` is a short description of the mint that can be shown in the wallet next to the mint's name. 
- `description_long` is a long description that can be shown in an additional field.
- `methods` is an array of arrays of method-unit pairs that the mint supports
- `nuts` is an array that shows which NUTs the mint supports. 
- `contact` is an array of contact methods to reach the mint operator. A contact method consists of two fields. The first denotes the method (like "email"), the second the identifier (like "contact@me.com").
- `modt` is the message of the day that the wallet must display to the user. It should only be used to display important announcements to users, such as scheduled maintenances. 
- `parameter` configuration fields that specifies mint parameters
  - `peg_out_only` is a `boolean` value if the mint allows peg-in/out or only peg-out    

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/info
```

## Methods
The `methods` field in the info response indicates which currency `unit` can be minted and melted using which payment `method`. For example, if the mint supports `["bolt11", "sat"]`, it means that the endpoints

```
POST /v1/mint/bolt11
``` 
and 

```
POST /v1/melt/bolt11
```
support minting ([NUT-04][04]) and melting ([NUT-05][05]) ecash with the unit `sat`.
