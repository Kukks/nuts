NUT-00: Notation and Models
==========================

`mandatory` `author: calle`

---

- Sending user: `Alice`
- Receiving user: `Carol`
- Mint: `Bob`

## Bob (mint)

- `k` private key of mint (one for each amount)
- `K` public key of mint
- `Q` promise (blinded signature)

## Alice (user)

- `x` random string (secret message), corresponds to point `Y` on curve
- `r` private key (blinding factor)
- `T` blinded message
- `Z` proof (unblinded signature)

# Blind Diffie-Hellmann key exchange (BDHKE)

- Mint `Bob` publishes public key `K = kG` 
- `Alice` picks secret `x` and computes `Y = hash_to_curve(x)`
- `Alice` sends to `Bob`: `B_ = Y + rG` with `r` being a random blinding factor (**blinding**)
- `Bob` sends back to `Alice` blinded key: `C_ = kB_` (these two steps are the DH key exchange) (**signing**)
- `Alice` can calculate the unblinded key as `C_ - rK = kY + krG - krG = kY = C` (**unblinding**)
- Alice can take the pair `(x, C)` as a token and can send it to `Carol`.
- `Carol` can send `(x, C)` to `Bob` who then checks that `k*hash_to_curve(x) == C` (**verification**), and if so treats it as a valid spend of a token, adding `x`  to the list of spent secrets.

## 0.1 - Models

### `BlindedMessage`

An encrypted ("blinded") secret and an amount is sent from `Alice` to `Bob` for [minting tokens][04] or for [splitting tokens][06]. A `BlindedMessage` is also called an `output`.

```json
{
  "amount": int,
  "id": hex_str,
  "B_": hex_str
}
```

 `amount` is the value for the requested `BlindSignature`, `id` is the requested keyset ID from which we expect a signature,  and `B_` is the blinded secret message generated by `Alice`. An array `[BlindedMessage]` is also referred to as `BlindedMessages`.

### `BlindedSignature`

A `BlindedSignature` is sent from `Bob` to `Alice` after [minting tokens][04] or after [splitting tokens][06]. A `BlindedSignature` is also called a `promise`.

```json
{
  "amount": int,
  "C_": hex_str,
  "id": hex_str
}
```

`amount` is the value of the blinded token, `C_` is the blinded signature on the secret message `B_` sent in the previous step. `id` is the [keyset id][02] of the mint keys that signed the token. 

### `Proof`

A `Proof` is also called an input and is generated by `Alice` from a `BlindedSignature` it received. An array `[Proof]` is called `Proofs`. `Alice` sends `Proofs` to `Bob` for [melting tokens][05]. [Serialized](#serialization-of-tokens) `Proofs` can also be sent from `Alice` to `Carol`. Upon receiving the token, `Carol` deserializes it and requests a [split][06] from `Bob` to receive new `Proofs`. 

```json
{
  "amount": int, 
  "id": hex_str,
  "secret": str,
  "C": hex_str,
}
```

`amount` is the value of the `Proof`, `secret` is the secret message (no encoding standard), `C` is the unblinded signature on `secret` (hex string), `id` is the [keyset id][02] of the mint public keys that signed the token (hex string).

## 0.2 - Methods

### Serialization of tokens

Tokens can be serialized to send them between users `Alice` and `Carol`. Serialized tokens have a Cashu token prefix, a versioning flag, and the token. Optionally, a URI prefix for making tokens clickable on the web.

We use the following format for token serialization:

```sh
cashu[version][token]
```

#### 0.2.1 - V3 tokens

Wallets serialize tokens in a `base64_urlsafe` format (base64 encoding with `/` replaced by `_` and `+` by `-`). 

```sh
cashu[version][base64_token_json]
```

`cashu` is the Cashu token prefix. `[version]` is a single `base64_urlsafe` character to denote the token format version (starting with `A` for the present token format). `[base64_token_json]` is the token JSON serialized in `base64_urlsafe`. A `[base64_token_json]` should be cleared of any whitespace before serializing.

##### Version
This token format has the `[version]` value `A`.

##### URI tags

To make Cashu tokens clickable on the web, we use the URI tags `cashu:` or `cashu://` or `web+cashu://` (for PWAs).

A serialized token with URI tag becomes 

```sh
cashu:cashuAeyJwcm9vZn...
```

##### Token format

The deserialized `base64_token_json` is

```json
{
  "token": [
    {
      "mint": str,
      "proofs": Proofs
    },
    ...
  ],
  "unit": str <optional>,
  "memo": str <optional>
}
```
`mint` is the mint URL, `Proofs` is an array of `Proof` objects. The next two elements are only for displaying the receiving user appropriate information: `unit` is the currency unit of the token keysets (see [Keysets][01] for supported units), and `memo` is an optional text memo from the sender. 


##### Example JSON

```json
{
  "token": [
    {
      "mint": "https://8333.space:3338",
      "proofs": [
        {
          "id": "9bb9d58392cd823e",
          "amount": 2,
          "secret": "EhpennC9qB3iFlW8FZ_pZw",
          "C": "02c020067db727d586bc3183aecf97fcb800c3f4cc4759f69c626c9db5d8f5b5d4"
        },
        {
          "id": "9bb9d58392cd823e",
          "amount": 8,
          "secret": "TmS6Cv0YT5PU_5ATVKnukw",
          "C": "02ac910bef28cbe5d7325415d5c263026f15f9b967a079ca9779ab6e5c2db133a7"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "unit": "sat",
  "memo": "Thank you."
}
```

When serialized, this becomes:
