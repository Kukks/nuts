NUT-03: Quote mint
==========================

`mandatory` `author: calle`

---

Minting tokens is a two-step process: requesting a mint quote and requesting a mint of tokens. Here, we describe the first step. A wallet requests the minting of tokens in exchange for paying a bolt11 Lightning invoice (typically generated by the mint to add funds to its reserves, and typically paid with another Lightning wallet).

To request the minting of tokens, a wallet `Alice` sends a `GET /mint?amount=<amount>` request with the requested amount `<amount>` in satoshis. The mint `Bob` then responds with a Lightning invoice.

## Example

Request of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/mint?amount=1000
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/mint?amount=1000
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "request": "lnbc100n1p3kdrv5sp5lpdxzghe5j67q...",
  "method": "bolt11",
  "symbol": "sat",
  "amount": 1000,
  "id": "67d1d9ea6ada225c115418671b64a..."
}
```

with `method` being the payment method, `request` being the payment request and `id` is a **unique and random** id generated by the mint to internally look up the payment state. Note: `id` **MUST** remain a secret between user and mint and **MUST NOT** be derivable from the payment request or otherwise a third party who knows the payment request can stealing the tokens that this operation mints (See [NUT-04][04]).

A wallet **MUST** store the `id` and `amount` in its database to later request the tokens upon paying the invoice. A wallet **SHOULD** then present the payment request (for example via QR code) to the user such that they can pay the invoice with another Lightning wallet. After the user has paid the invoice, a wallet **MUST** continue with [NUT-04][04] (minting tokens).
